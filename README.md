# Lipidify
Python interface for analysing x-ray scattering from self-assembled lyotropic liquid crystalline phases

Provides a basic GUI for analysing 1D data. The software is intended for data generated by PYFAI. 

The interface allows for automated phase detection and lattice parameter calculation. Calculators for water channel thickness.

Identification is faciliated through user-optimized background correction and peak filtering. 

Identification will also provide multi-phase solutions (in progress)
